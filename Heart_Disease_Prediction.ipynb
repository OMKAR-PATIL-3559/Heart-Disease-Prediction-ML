        "The parameter kde=True adds a KDE curve, which is a smooth line showing the shape of age distribution.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Mean (average age) with a red line\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Mode (most common age) with a blue line\n",

        "\n",
        "### **2)What this output means:**\n",
        "Mean = 53.51\n",
        "→ The average age of all people in the dataset is around 53.5 years.\n",
        "\n",
        "Median = 54.0\n",
        "→ Half of the people are younger than 54, and half are older.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mode = 54\n",
        "→ 54 is the age that appears most often in the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "These three values being very close means the age distribution is almost balanced and normal.\n",
        "\n",
        "The lines on the histogram help to understand the center and shape of the data visually.\n",
        "\n",

        "### **1)What happens in this step:**\n",
        "In this step, we create an interactive histogram using the Plotly library.\n",
        "\n",
        "The function px.histogram() from Plotly Express is used to make the chart.\n",
        "\n",
        "The chart shows the distribution of the 'age' column on the x-axis (horizontal axis).\n",
        "\n",
        "The color='sex' part means the bars in the chart will be colored by gender — for example:\n",
        "\n",
        "One color for Male\n",
        "\n",
        "Another color for Female\n",
        "\n",
        "This helps to compare the age distribution between males and females.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, fig.show() displays the interactive plot, which allows the user to hover, zoom, and explore the chart.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2) What this output means:**\n",
        "This chart shows how males and females are distributed across different ages.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can quickly see:\n",
        "\n",
        "Which gender is more common in which age range.\n",
        "\n",
        "If the data is balanced or not between males and females.\n",
        "\n",
        "Because this is interactive, it is easy for users or teachers to explore the data visually.\n",
        "\n",
        "This step adds a professional and beautiful look to your project and helps in understanding gender-based patterns in heart disease data.\n",

        "Finally, we used fig.show() to display the interactive plot.\n",

        "\n",
        "Each chest pain type is shown in a different color, making it easy to compare:\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, we can see at which age \"asymptomatic\" or \"typical angina\" pain types are more common.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "### **1) What Happened in this Step?**\n",
        "We imported the Plotly Express library using import plotly.express as px.\n",
        "Plotly is used to make beautiful, interactive charts.\n",
        "\n",
        "Then we created a histogram chart using px.histogram().\n",
        "\n",
        "data_frame=df: We used our main dataset (df).\n",
        "\n",
        "x='cp': We plotted the chest pain type column on the x-axis.\n",
        "\n",
        "color='num': We colored the bars based on the target column num, which shows heart disease stages (0, 1, 2, 3, 4).\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, we displayed this interactive plot using fig.show().\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2) What Happened in the Output?**\n",
        "The output shows a colorful histogram chart:\n",
        "\n",
        "Each bar represents a type of chest pain (cp).\n",
        "\n",
        "Each bar is split by colors showing the count of people in each heart disease stage (from 0 = no disease to 4 = most severe).\n",
        "\n",
        "This helps us understand which type of chest pain is most common in people with and without heart disease.\n",

        "First, we import plotly.graph_objects to create beautiful and interactive plots.\n",
        "\n",
        "We use go.Figure() to start creating the plot.\n",

        "For patients with heart disease → shown in red\n",
        "\n",
        "We set plot title, Y-axis label, and make the axis lines bold and visible in black.\n",
        "\n",
        "A violin plot is useful because:\n",
        "\n",
        "It shows how the data is spread out (distribution).\n",
        "\n",
        "It shows where the data is dense or less frequent.\n",
        "\n",
        "It also shows the thickness (density) of values like a mirror image violin shape.\n",

        "\n",
        "The wider part of the shape shows more people had those cholesterol values.\n",

        "\n",
        "Then, we counted how many people of each age fall under each heart disease group.\n",
        "This helps us see which age groups are more affected by heart disease.\n",

        "Next, we created a histogram using Seaborn.\n",
        "This is a bar chart that shows the distribution of ages.\n",
        "We used the 'hue=num' option to show different colors for people with and without heart disease.\n",
        "So, we can easily compare how age is connected to heart disease.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2) What Happened in the Output?**\n",
        "The output first gives a table that shows, for each age, how many people had or didn’t have heart disease.\n",
        "Then, the histogram plot shows colorful bars where:\n",
        "\n",
        "The X-axis shows patient ages\n",
        "\n",
        "The height of bars shows how many people are there at each age\n",
        "\n",
        "The color shows whether they had heart disease or not\n",

        "We used plotly.express (short form: px), which is a library that helps us create interactive charts.\n",
        "\n",
        "We used the function px.histogram() to make a bar chart that shows:\n",
        "\n",
        "How many people are there in each age group\n",
        "\n",
        "How many of them have heart disease or not\n",
        "\n",
        "We used the parameter color='num' to show:\n",
        "\n",
        "People with heart disease in one color\n",
        "\n",
        "People with no heart disease in another color\n",
        "\n",
        "So this plot makes it easy to compare age groups between healthy and sick people.\n",

        "### **2) What Happened in the Output?**\n",
        "The output is a colorful interactive histogram.\n",

        "The X-axis shows the age of patients\n",
        "\n",
        "The Y-axis shows how many people are there at each age\n",
        "\n",
        "The color of each bar tells us whether those people have heart disease or not\n",

        "# **(58)Step 58: Clean Column Values, Create New Dataset, and Prepare for Modeling**\n",
        "### **1) What Happened in This Step?**\n",
        "In this step, we are cleaning and preparing the data to make it easy for the machine learning model to understand. Here's what we did:\n",
        "\n",
        "A) Replaced spaces in some values\n",
        "\n",
        "Some columns like thal, cp, and restecg had values with spaces (e.g. \"fixed defect\").\n",
        "\n",
        "Spaces can create problems later.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, we changed them to use underscores (e.g. \"fixed_defect\").\n",
        "\n",
        "This makes data cleaner and easier to use.\n",
        "\n",
        "B) Made a new dataset with only useful columns\n",
        "\n",
        "We selected only the columns we really need for prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: age, sex, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "This helps in keeping things simple and focused.\n",
        "\n",
        "C) Converted the target column to 0 or 1\n",
        "\n",
        "Original column num had values like 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.\n",
        "\n",
        "But we want only two results:\n",
        "0 = No heart disease\n",
        "1 = Has heart disease\n",
        "\n",
        "So, we converted it using simple logic:\n",
        "If value is more than 0, then it's 1. Otherwise, it’s 0.\n",
        "\n",
        "D) Converted text columns to numbers\n",
        "\n",
        "Machine learning works better with numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "So we changed:\n",
        "\n",
        "sex: Male = 1, others = 0\n",
        "\n",
        "fbs and exang: Already in 0 and 1, we confirmed it by re-encoding.\n",
        "\n",
        "E) Renamed column names for clarity\n",
        "\n",
        "Some column names were short or confusing (like cp, thalch, slope).\n",
        "\n",
        "We gave them better names like:\n",
        "\n",
        "cp ➝ chest_pain_type\n",
        "\n",
        "trestbps ➝ resting_blood_pressure\n",
        "\n",
        "thal ➝ thalassemia_type\n",
        "\n",
        "This helps you and your teacher understand the data better.\n",
        "\n",
        "F) Displayed first 5 rows of new data\n",
        "\n",
        "We used .head() to see how the cleaned data looks.\n",
        "\n",
        "It shows first 5 rows from the updated table.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2) What Happened in the Output?**\n",
        "The output showed the clean and updated table.\n",
        "\n",
        "It has easy column names and numerical values.\n",
        "\n",
        "Target column now shows only 0 or 1 (no disease / has disease).\n",
        "\n",
        "Everything is now ready for the next step: feature encoding and model training."

        "In this step, we built a Random Forest machine learning model to predict heart disease. We also used hyperparameter tuning to improve the model’s accuracy. Let’s break this step into small parts:\n",
        "\n",
        "A) Separated data into input (X) and target (y)\n",
        "\n",
        "X means input columns like age, cholesterol, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "y means target column (target) — this shows if a person has heart disease (1) or not (0).\n",
        "\n",
        "B) Converted text (categorical) columns into numbers\n",
        "\n",
        "Some columns have words like \"typical_angina\", \"male\", etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "ML doesn’t understand words, so we used LabelEncoder to change text into numbers (like 0, 1, 2...).\n",
        "\n",
        "C) Split data into Train and Test parts\n",
        "\n",
        "We used 70% data to train the model and 30% to test the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "This helps us check how well the model will perform on unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        "D) Scaled all values between 0 and 1\n",
        "\n",
        "We used MinMaxScaler to make sure all features have similar range.\n",
        "\n",
        "This helps improve model performance.\n",

        "Random Forest is a powerful model made of many decision trees.\n",
        "\n",
        "We used it to predict if someone has heart disease.\n",
        "\n",
        "F) Did hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search\n",
        "\n",
        "We tried different settings like number of trees, depth of tree, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "GridSearchCV tried all combinations and picked the best one.\n",
        "\n",
        "It used 5-fold cross-validation to find which setup gives highest accuracy.\n",

        "G) Trained the best model\n",

        "We trained Random Forest using the best settings (found by GridSearchCV).\n",
        "\n",
        "Then we used this model to make predictions on test data.\n",
        "\n",
        "H) Calculated Accuracy of Model\n",
        "\n",
        "Accuracy means how many predictions were correct.\n",
        "\n",
        "We printed it using accuracy_score.\n",
        "\n",
        "I) Reversed the label encoding (Optional)\n",
        "\n",
        "After model training, we changed numbers back to original text for better understanding.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2)What Happened in the Output?**\n",
