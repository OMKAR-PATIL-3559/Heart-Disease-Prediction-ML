# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project predicts heart disease using Random Forest and XGBoost on the Cleveland dataset. It focuses on data cleaning, visualization, feature analysis, and model evaluation.

## Objectives
- Predict heart disease with high accuracy
- Perform data preprocessing and feature analysis
- Evaluate model performance using metrics and visualizations

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

## Key Steps Performed
- Data loading and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model building with Random Forest and XGBoost
- Performance evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix)

## Dataset
- Cleveland Heart Disease Dataset (`heart.csv`)
- Each CSV represents structured data used for prediction

## Output / Visuals
